LCD Screen Brightness Control

This is a seed code to allow adjusting the brightness of the DFRobot LCD Keypad Shield.  The program uses an analog read to decide which button is being pressed.
A switch case state decides to increase or decrease the LCD backlight brightness based on the button being pressed.

This code can be adapted to read all of the buttons to be used for almost any function.
